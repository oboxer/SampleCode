SQL ETL project
You need to design a data warehouse/data store ETL/ELT system to manage data for a B2B e-commerce site. The data store system has three defined data sources that feed the data to the system :
• B2B platform database
• Log data from the web server
• Marketing lead spreadsheet file
B2B platform
Companies may have many end Customers. The B2B platform allows them to buy Products from qualified Suppliers and sell them to end Customers.
End Customers are people who are identified by their document number, the full name, date of birth.
Companies are identified by CUIT number (a unique identifier), name
Suppliers are just a different type of company, and they expose a list of Products and
default prices.
Each Company can define its own price list (catalog) using Products from many Suppliers. They can also place Orders to the platform indicating which end customer has to receive the goods
Marketing Lead file
The lead file is extracted periodically from the B2B shared Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system. The lead file structure is represented as :
Lead file format
Column | Data Type | Comment -----------------|-----------|-------------------------------- -----------------------
Id               | LONG      | Unique identifier of a lead
Quote_Product_id | INT       | Id of product in a lead
Quote_Price
lead
Quote_Value
Sale_flag
into a sale
Order_Id
into a sale
Customer_Id
associated with the lead
Company_Id       | LONG
| CURRENCY  | Price offered on a product in a
| CURRENCY  | Dollar total quoted for a lead
| BOOLEAN
| LONG
| LONG
| Marks whether the lead turns
| Order number if the lead turns
| Identifier of the customer
| Identifier of the company
associated with the lead
Created_Date     | DATE      | Date the lead was generated
Weblog data
The clients are accessing B2B website from various devices and geo-locations. This data is represented in the combined log format.
LogFormat "%h %l %u %t \"%r\" %>s %b \"%{Referer}i\" \"%{User-agent}i\"" combined
• %h is the remote host (ie the client IP)
• %l is the identity of the user determined by identd (not usually used since not reliable)
• %u is the username determined by HTTP authentication
• %t is the time the request was received.
• %r is the request line from the client. ("GET / HTTP/1.0")
• %>s is the status code sent from the server to the client (200, 404 etc.)
• %b is the size of the response to the client (in bytes)
• Referer is the Referer header of the HTTP request (containing the URL of the page
from which this request was initiated) if any is present, and "-" otherwise.
• User-agent is the browser identification string.
For our project, the relevant data of this data sources is the client IP, username, time. You can omit other data as non-relevant data.
The target data store is the foundation for these reports :
• How much leads are given to an inputted client
• What are the most popular used devices for B2B clients (top 5)
• What are the most popular products in the country from which most users log into
• All sales of B2B platform displayed monthly for the last year
Requirements
For the project solution, please prepare the following:
1) Database implementation with generated data for the B2B database source
2) Lead file csv file with generated data
3) Weblog generated via script in a language of your choosing
4) A target database which represents the data warehouse or data mart, you can choose relation or NoSQL solution
5) ETL/ELT* process with transformations that will :
• Fill the initial load of the target data store
• Be restartable if the jobs or subjob fails
• Support update/insert (UPSERT) execution
• Handle erroneous data
• Track ETL/ELT metadata (when did the load start, break, finish)
• Transform the data into a readable data format for reporting
• Demonstrate the ability to transform large data size
* Use any ETL/ELT tool or hand code the ETL/ELT process
